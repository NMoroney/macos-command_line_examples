## macOS : Command Line Examples - VTK (Circulatory System)

Use [Open Asset Importer library](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) (5.3.1) to read the FBX encoded [circulatory system](https://github.com/LluisV/Z-Anatomy/tree/PC-Version/Resources/Models/FBX) of the [Z-Anatomy](https://github.com/LluisV/Z-Anatomy) project.

The FBX is then saved as a binary PLY file. This file is then read and renedered by the [Visualization Toolkit (VTK)](https://vtk.org) (9.2.6_5).
