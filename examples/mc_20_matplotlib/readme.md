## *Matplotlib (simplex noise contours)

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) is a Python library for visualization.

It can be installed with ```pip3 install matplotlib```.

This example uses a script to automate the generation of PNG's directly from formatted TSV files.

In this case the [earlier example](../mc_07_pip3/) generating simplex noise is visualized as a contour surface.
