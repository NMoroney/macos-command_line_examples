## macOS : Command Line Examples - *CGAL (3D Convex Hull)*

CGAL or the [Computational Geometry Algorithms Library](https://www.cgal.org) provides a wide range of geometry processing algorithms in C++.

This example computes a 3D [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) for the vertices of an input mesh.

The results below show the convex hull as thicker black lines which entirely contain the teal mesh.

The above results were generated using [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net).
